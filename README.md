# AI and Big Data Innovation at Aramco

## Overview and Origin

Aramco, officially the Saudi Arabian Oil Group, is a majority state-owned petroleum and natural gas company that is the national oil company of Saudi Arabia.  Aramco began in 1933 when a concession agreement was signed between the Saudi Arabian government and the Standard Oil Company of California (SoCal).  From the late 1940s, Aramco experienced a radical expansion across Saudi Arabia.  Its annual crude oil and petroleum products capacity exceeded 1 billion barrels by 1971.  As of 2024, it is the fourth largest company in the world by revenue.

Aramco recognizes the benefits of rapid expansion of AI in the recent years.  Through its __Digital Transformation Program__ since 2017, Aramco is positioned to harness the power of AI and Big Data.


## Business Activities

Aramco's goal is to leverage AI technological advancements to become a leading digitalized energy company.  Specifically, AI and Big Data solutions can optimize a wide variety of operations within the energy sector to deliver improved efficiency, reliability, and sustainability.

One example of the AI applications at Aramco is *flare monitoring*.  Flaring is the release and combustion of hydrocarbon gases caused by the build-up of pressure in pipelines and processing facilities.  According to the World Bank, flaring persists from the beginning of oil production over 160 years ago to this day because it is a relatively safe, though wasteful and polluting, method of disposing associated gas.  During crude oil extraction and processing, a sudden or dramatic increase in pressure could cause an explosion.  Flaring allows operators to de-pressurize their equipment and manage unpredictable and large pressure variations by burning any excess gas.  

Aramco has 18,000 data sources that supply information, allowing visualized monitoring of the entire gas processing system at once, and forecasting for flaring.  By comparing this real-time data to models built using various Big Data processing techniques, the Aramco in-house-developed AI systems can predict when a facility is going to exceed its flaring targets.  This enables engineers to quickly identify sources of flaring and then generate potential solutions.  The use of Big Data and AI has contributed to a greater than __50% reduction in Aramco's flaring__ since 2010.  Aramco has been able to maintain an industry-leading flare volume of below 1% of total raw gas production for the past decade.  This unique application and achievement set Aramco apart from other energy companies in reducing waste and pollution, and enhancing safety and process reliability.


## Landscape

Aramco is the largest oil and gas company in the world with a market capitalization at $1.74 trillion.  Exxon Mobil is second at $532 billion, followed by Chevron at $273 billion.

According to Instinctools, a software production development and consulting company, there are 5 major forms AI used in the oil and gas industry:

	> Machine learning: Analyzes data for pattern recognition to predict outcomes and, overall, optimize tasks across various operational levels. Often used in reservoir exploration, drilling, or fault detection.
	>
	> Deep learning: As a more advanced form of ML, deep learning utilizes complex neural networks for tasks like precise seismic analysis to process data and identify more complex details within it.
	>
	> Generative AI: Learning from existing datasets, gen AI creates, for example, new data samples, emergency instructions, or smart summaries.
	>
	> Natural Language Processing (NLP) and computer vision: Interpret human language and visual data for tasks like report generation and quality control. 
	>
	> Edge AI: Processes data locally on IoT devices without relying on cloud storage or internet connectivity.


## Results

In addition to the previously mentioned *flare monitoring*, Aramco has implemented AI solutions at its Khurais oil filed with __40,000 censors__ to monitor over __500 oil wells__, creating the world's first *Advanced Process Control (APC)* for a conventional oil field.  These AI solutions include optimizing fuel gas consumption in boilers, using robotics to make maintenance operations safer, cheaper and more efficient, and deploying a pipeline management system to detect possible leaks using fiber optics as a sensor.  These digital solutions have helped the Khurais oil field achieve a __15% increase in oil production__ and a __100% improvement in troubleshooting response times__.

Aramco believes digital transformation is pivotal to the future of the oil and gas industry.  AI and Big Data have an almost limitless range of potential applications in every one of its business units.


## Recommendations

One of the hot AI topics in oil and gas is predictive maintenance and asset management.  AI-powered predictive maintenance solutions monitor equipment via sensors and data analytics.  Beyond detecting problems, these systems can predict problems, enabling prompt repair.  This proactive approach to schedule maintenance lowers unplanned downtime and maintenance costs for oil & gas companies and extends crucial machineryâ€™s lifespan.  It can also reduce catastrophic equipment failures that could result in mishaps and accidents.

Machine Learning models play a crucial role in predictive maintenance and help to analyze existing data, identify patterns, and make predictions about failures or equipment maintenance needs.
